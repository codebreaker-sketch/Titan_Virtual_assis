# Titan_Virtual_assis
As part of my role, I developed a voice-activated virtual assistant named Titan. This assistant can recognize voice commands to open websites, play music from a custom library, and read the latest news headlines. One of the coolest features is that Titan can be interrupted with a "stop" command while reading the news.
